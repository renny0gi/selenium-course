# Task from Stepik-course module 3.6 step 9. #
This dir is supposed to be a new repo, but since it doesn't make any sence to create a new repo for just 1 task I've made use of the existing repo from the module 2.

To start the test:
    * git clone https://github.com/renny0gi/selenium-course
    * cd selenium-course
    * cd lesson18_step9
    * pytest --language=es test_items.py
